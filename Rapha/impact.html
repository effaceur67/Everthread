                                    <h3>Excessive use of Water:</h3>
                                        <p>Fast fashion puts enormous pressure on global water resources, largely because of the heavy reliance on cotton and the intensive processes needed to turn raw fibers into clothing. Studies show that the textile and apparel industry consumes around 93 billion cubic meters of water per year (which is about 4 % of all global freshwater withdrawal). To put this in perspective: producing a single cotton T-shirt typically requires roughly 2,700 liters of water, while a pair of jeans can demand 7,500 to 10,000 liters.</p>

                                        <p>The industry is responsible for about 20% of global clean-water pollution, largely through toxic dyeing and finishing processes that pour untreated wastewater into rivers and streams.Moreover, washing synthetic garments(very common in fast fashion) releases vast quantities of microplastics: estimates suggest that textiles account for up to 35% of primary microplastics entering the oceans. </p>

                                    <h3>Waste of Clothes:</h3>
                                        <p> Fast fashion generates a vast amount of textile waste: globally, about 92 million tonnes of textile waste are produced each year. Because garments are often cheaply made and designed for short-term use, many clothes are discarded after only a few wears; in some reports the average garment is worn only 7 to 10 times before being thrown away. Only a small fraction (less than 1%) of discarded textiles are recycled into new garments.The rest often ends up in landfills or incinerated, contributing to pollution, waste of resources and ongoing environmental damage.</p>

                                        <p>Fast fashion is not just cheap and trendy, it is also one of the world’s most polluting industries. The global textile and apparel sector is estimated to produce between 8% and 10% of all greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide, rivaling or even surpassing the combined emissions of international aviation and maritime transport. Each year it generates roughly 1.2 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, according to recent analyses. </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Workers often endure extremely long hours, sometimes 12 to 16 hour shifts, six or seven days a week, especially during production peaks.</li>
                                <li>Many garment workers are paid far below a living wage, forcing them to work excessive hours just to afford basic necessities.</li>
                                <li>Factories frequently have unsafe and overcrowded conditions, with poor ventilation, high temperatures, exposure to toxic chemicals, and a high risk of injury.</li>
                                <li>Employees,many of them women,face intense pressure and unrealistic production targets, leading to physical strain, repetitive-stress injuries, and constant supervision.</li>
                                <li>In some regions, workers experience verbal abuse, harassment, and restrictions on unionizing, preventing them from advocating for better conditions or fair pay.</li>
