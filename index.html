        <p>Fast fashion is destroying our planet but we can change that. 
            <br>
            At Everthread we belive fashion can be beatiful, ethical, and sustainable. 
            <br>
            Join us to make conscious choises that protect people and the environment.
        </p>


        <h2>What is Fast Fashion?</h2>
        <p> Fast Fashion means producing clothes quickly and cheaply to follow the latest trends. <br>
            But behind every low price are polluted rivers, exploited workers, and mountains of textile waste. <br>
            The true cost of fashion is far greater than what we see on the price tag.</p>


        <h2>The Hidden Cost of Cheap Clothes</h2> 
        <p>The fashion industry is one of the most polluting in the world. <br> 
            It produces around 10% of global carbon emissions and uses thousands of liters of water for a single garment. <br> 
            Tons of discared clothes end up in landfills or are burned, realising toxic chemicals into the air and soil. <br> 
            Worse still, millions of children and workers are exploited in unsafe factories to keep prices low.</p>

            
        <h2>We Stand for Slow Fashion</h2>
        <p>Slow fashion is about quality, care, and respect - for the planet and for the people who make our clothes. <br>
            It means buying less but better: clothes that are well-made, ethically procuced, and designed to last. <br>
            We promote transparency, sustainibility, and creativity in every piece we offer <br> 
        <h4>Our approach:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Support fair working conditions</li>
            <li>Use natural and recycled materials</li>
            <li>Encourage repair, reuse, and mindful consumption</li>
        </ul></p>
