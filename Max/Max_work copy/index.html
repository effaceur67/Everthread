    <h2>What is Fast Fashion?</h2>
    <p>Fast Fashion means producing clothes quickly and cheaply to follow trends.
       But behind every low price are polluted rivers, exploited workers, and textile waste.</p>

    <h2>The Hidden Cost of Cheap Clothes</h2>
    <p>The fashion industry generates 10% of global carbon emissions and uses thousands of liters of water per garment.
       Tons of clothes end up in landfills or are burned, releasing toxic chemicals. Workers are underpaid and exposed to dangerous conditions.</p>
